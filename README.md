This is my first project where I explore JavaScript Html and CSS.  I have just started studying code and am using this to gain practical experience.   
The challenges this project presented for myself while learning to code have been rewarding to overcome and fill me with pride!
<br>  I will continue to develop this project possibly making it a stand alone app in 'Electron' or incorporating a back-end in Python or node.js for users to save their progress.
I plan to add in the campaign next, as present in the board game.

GOALS of this Project; <br>
 ~~Create 1v1 with static equipment and 1 enemy~~  <br>
 ~~ability to name character~~  <br>
 ~~choose different character cards~~  <br>
 ~~A market where you can buy equipment~~  <br>
